# 🎢 About the Minecraft Theme Park

The **Minecraft Theme Park** is a creative Minecraft project by the German YouTubers and streamers [TheJoCraft](https://www.youtube.com/@TheJoCraft) and [IOser100](https://www.youtube.com/@IOser100). After already building the fascinating “Rotstein Park,” **Josef Heinrich Bogatzki** and **Janus Vorrath** launched the long-term project Minecraft Theme Park in 2023 – featuring a wide variety of attractions, rides, and interactive experiences.

For a long time, the two content creators have been offering weekly streams on **YouTube** and **Twitch**, pushing the limits of what’s possible in Minecraft. To do so, they rely exclusively on *vanilla\** Minecraft features and implement all systems using **command blocks**, **data packs**, and **resource packs** only.

While **IOser100** mainly focuses on the park’s design and visuals, **TheJoCraft** is responsible for the technical implementation. This includes many innovative mechanics that make the park experience truly unique.

> \* *Vanilla* means that no mods, plug-ins, or external extensions are used. The park is fully compatible with any standard, unmodified version of Minecraft.
